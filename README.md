# MiniRT

**MiniRT** is a lightweight ray tracer written in C, designed to create realistic 3D images through a custom minimal graphics library.

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects to produce highly detailed visuals. By tracing the paths of light rays through a virtual scene, it generates lifelike reflections, shadows, and materials with great accuracy.

This project is entirely CPU-based and built specifically for Linux environments.

## ‚ú® Features

- **BVH Tree** acceleration (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) for efficient ray-object intersection tests
- **Multithreaded** rendering for faster image computation
- **SIMD** optimizations for faster vector math and BVH navigation
- **Cache** optimization for improved memory access patterns
- **Real-Time** rendering (continuous updates on camera movement)
- **Anti-Aliasing** for smoother edges
- **Trimesh** object support (.obj file loading)
- Switchable **Camera Modes** (orbit or static mode)
- **Mouse & Keyboard** controls to move and rotate the camera
- **Pure CPU-based** calculations, no GPU acceleration
- Supports planes, spheres, cylinders, rectangles, and triangles
