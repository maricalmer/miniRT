# MiniRT

**MiniRT** is a C-based mini ray tracer that utilizes a minimal graphics library.

A ray tracer is a computer graphics technique used to create highly realistic images by simulating the behavior of light in a virtual 3D environment. In ray tracing, the core concept revolves around tracing the path of light rays as they interact with objects and surfaces within a scene.

This project focuses purely on **CPU calculations** and runs **only on Linux** systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **BVH Tree** acceleration (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) for efficient ray-object intersection tests
- **Multithreaded** rendering for faster image computation
- **SIMD** optimizations for faster vector math and BVH navigation
- **Cache** optimization for improved memory access patterns
- **Real-Time** rendering (continuous updates on camera movement)
- **Anti-Aliasing** for smoother edges
- **Trimesh** object support (.obj file loading)
- Switchable **Camera Modes** (orbit or static mode)
- **Mouse & Keyboard** controls to move and rotate the camera
- **Pure CPU-based** calculations, no GPU acceleration
- Supports planes, spheres, cylinders, rectangles, and triangles
